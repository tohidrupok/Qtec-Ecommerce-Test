[QSL Problem # 1] - Jan 2024

Step 1: Create an ORM Data Model using any Python web framework for an ecommerce product category page. At your backend, you can create unlimited Filtering & Search Options with Unlimited values for each one. Like, Categories, Brands, Warranty, Sellers etc. You can create a product as well if you feel necessary.


For example, If you have a Category Filtering Option,  values might be Smartphone, Earphone, Power Bank etc. If you have a Warranty Filtering Option, values might be 1 Year Warranty, 2 Years warranty etc. You can have a price range as well. Or search product by product category, name, brand, etc.

Step 2: Show those results that was inserted from backend admin panel in a view[html/css] and add some filters like the image 1:

Step 3: If I select any of those checkboxes, results will be filtered real time. You can use raw JS, Vue Js or any other frontend tech you are comfortable with. Or, itâ€™s up to you. You can create and solve the way you like.
